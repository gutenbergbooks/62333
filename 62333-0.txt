Introduction.


The utility of a DIRECTORY in so extensive and populous a city as
Norwich, is so very obvious, that little need be said on its eligibility.
The contents are so fully expressed in the title-page, and the
arrangement of matter so well adapted to every capacity, that any
explanation here would be offering an insult to the understandings of our
fellow-citizens; as well as to the intelligent stranger, and inhabitant
of any of the commercial towns, among whom, no doubt, a work of this kind
cannot fail of being in great request.

This city, though abounding in opulence and fashion, has long laboured
under great inconvenience on account of the difficulty of ascertaining,
precisely, the address of its inhabitants, whether in trade or
independent: and this has been chiefly owing to want of PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS.  The vague and general name of a parish being the only
direction to persons of every denomination; so that the enquirer may
perambulate the boundaries of three or four adjoining parishes before he
can ultimately determine; as it frequently happens that one side of a
street is in one parish, the other in another.  To remedy this, in some
degree, the names of the streets have been put up in a few of the
parishes; but even this has been done in so partial and improper a
manner, that little benefit can accrue to the complainant.

That spirit of improvement so generally felt, has been greatly damped by
the attention to, and gloomy appearance of, national affairs; but now
that PEACE, the much-favoured handmaid of Heaven, smiles on the industry
of the citizens of Norwich, we hope they will, again, turn their thoughts
to that very desirable object.  We are well aware that there are persons
who, holding every species of rational and polite advancement in
contempt, are willing to creep through life without a single ray of
light, that does not center in their own narrow focus of human
perfection!  To these, as lumber thrown from the stock of mankind, we
recommend an emigration to the sandy plains of Arabia, or to the craggy
mountains of Lapland.  To be serious: the present publication has not
only the merit of being highly useful to the mercantile and curious of
_this day_, but may _hereafter_ be remembered as having tended to the
ease and ornament of posterity.

To find fault with the present without amending the future, is like
discovering an evil we cannot specificly cure.  We stoop not to such
negative virtues; but will freely and respectfully submit our ideas to
the consideration of the Police of this city, and to such other bodies
and individuals as are therein concerned—under the appellation of

                     _Hints for Public Improvements_.

1.  Every STREET, lane, and thoroughfare, should have its proper Name,
distinctly and correctly painted, and put up at the corner or entrance of
each.  To ascertain this, the church-wardens ought to consult authentic
records and history, and not to be guided by the vulgar or temporary
adoption of ill-informed persons.  We have endeavoured, as much as
possible, to be correct on this head; and, if found so, hope to be the
humble means of governing this regulation.

2.  The HOUSES in each street, &c. should necessarily be numbered.  The
mode of doing this, with precision, we have adopted, and doubt not but it
will also become the general rule:—Beginning from the Market-place on the
right hand, and returning on the left.  It may, however, be found proper
in some instances (as in streets remote, and in a contrary direction,
from the market) to be guided by convenience and situation.  We have had
due regard to this; and have affixed the numbers accordingly.—☞ The best
and cheapest mode of distinguishing the number of each house or shop, is
by painted figures on the door, above, or on each side.

3.  The hanging SIGNS in every part of the city should be taken down:
they are not only very dangerous and disagreeable in windy weather, but
interrupt the view, and impede the free circulation of air:—an object of
the first consequence in a great town.

4.  The WATER-SPOUTS have been chiefly removed; but we wish to have them
totally abolished; as indeed we do every public nuisance.

5.  This, and most other ancient towns are horridly paved: and it is
difficult, as well as expensive, to produce an alteration of so much
consequence, as that of raising the cause-way in the middle, with
channels and foot-paths (flag’d) on each side.  Many of the streets in
Norwich are too narrow to admit of this, but surely St. Giles’s
Broad-street, St. Stephen’s-street, Ber-street, King-street,
Magdalen-street, Coslany-street, Colegate-street, Upper Westwick-street,
&c. &c. might be rendered handsome and commodious by a pavement, in the
manner of Upper Surry street.

6.  The improvement lately made in the Lower Close, though it met with
much popular clamour and opposition, is very much to the honor of the
worthy gentleman who formed the inclosed area, now called _Lower Close_,
or _Dean Square_.  If the stables on the south side were to give way to
uniform dwelling-houses, the buildings would be more complete.

7.  The ground that has been levelled and cleared in front of St.
Andrew’s Hall, is one of the few improvements this city has lately
received.  Had the area been still more open and extended, the alteration
had been more perfect.

8.  As the road through the city is both difficult, dark, and dangerous,
we would propose opening and widening such parts as might render the
whole airy and easy of access.  To this end, the great entrance to the
_Market place_, through _Brigs’s-lane_, should be opened; at least, the
turn from the Rampant-horse-street, or Horse-market, should be rounded,
by taking away the corners.  From the _Market-place_ to the _Red Well_,
the _Cockey-lane_ and _London-lane_ is so narrow and irregular, that
frequent interruptions, and sometimes accidents, happen by carriages
meeting.  Persons on foot must squeeze themselves into a dark alley, or
burst into a shop, to avoid being run over or crushed against the walls;
whilst, in wet weather, you are drenched by torrents of water from the
houses, or plunged into a gutter, knee deep.

If the _Back of the Inns_ would admit of carriages, from the_ Hog-hill_
to _London-lane_, it would be a safer thorough-fare.  The houses and
stables on the west side are of little value, comparatively with the
advantage; and the rents of good houses and shops on that side, would
amply recompence the trouble and charge of rebuilding the street, at 25
or 30 feet width.

But, the readiest passage from _St. Stephen’s_ to _Tombland_ would be
made by opening the lane above the Bell Inn on Hog-hill, across the
_Castle Ditches_, to the _Red Well_.  The houses on the west side of the
lane, by Gurney’s bank, are much in decay: their removal, therefore,
would be attended with every advantage of profit and ornament.

9.  Supposing the communication to the _Red Well_ opened, the area of
waste ground, called the _Castle Meadow_, between the _Castle-hill_ and
_King-street_, would admit of buildings, on three sides, to form a very
spacious and handsome square.  This should be continued from the new
buildings behind Gurney’s Bank to the Griffin-yard, where a large opening
into King-street is much wanted.  From this, the east side will extend
along the back of King-street, and the south side terminate at the Duke
Tavern.  Within this, a considerable space might be pallisaded, and laid
out in shrubbery and pleasant walks: leaving a foot-pavement and carriage
road on each side.  As neat and convenient houses of 15, 18, and 20
pounds yearly rent are much wanted in Norwich, for genteel small
families, we have no doubt but CASTLE-SQUARE would soon be inhabited by
desirable tenants.  Many other improvements might and would be made on
the south-east side of the _Castle Ditches_, provided the above hints
were adhered to.

10.  It hath been proposed to inclose the _Upper Close_, in like manner
as the Lower, but this, we understand, has not been done, on account of
its being the _Play-ground_ of the _Grammar School_.  The _Prebend’s
Walk_ here is now become the fashionable MALL.

11.  The most eligible situation for a public walk is _Chapel-Field_.
Here every thing that taste and judgment could suggest might be done.
Trees planted; walks raised and gravelled; seats placed at certain
distances, and even a piece of water formed in the center.  The inner
parallel of the triangle railed, and a good carriage road on the outer.

12.  In so large and opulent a city as this, we have long wondered that
no attempt has been made, nor encouragement given, towards erecting a
neat and commodious suite of BATH ROOMS.  The field behind the
_Bowling-Green_, and fronting _Chapel-field_, is a proper situation for
such a building; and bathing and exercise are equally conducive to
health.  To support the expence of these rooms, (which should consist of
two cold or pleasure baths, and two Matlock, or warm baths, six or eight
dressing-rooms, a hot bath, vapour bath, and a sweating-room; a public
room for each sex, and other separate conveniencies) a perpetual or
annual subscription should be entered into; and the terms, attendance,
&c. put under such regulation, as might render the place fashionable,
delicate, and salubrious.

13.  If the _City Gates_ were totally erased, the air and prospect, to
and from the town, would be much improved.  When cities were surrounded
by walls and gates, the state of the times made such precautions
necessary; but now that the system of war, and the police of the country
is better understood and practiced, they become a nuisance, that smells
rank in the nose of modern improvement!  At least, if taking down the
_Gates_ be not thought necessary, the _Walls_, it is hoped, will be
levelled.

14.  Another great evil to be met with here, and in most towns, is, the
church yards being consecrated to receive the bodies of the deceased.
This practice is not only inconvenient and displeasing, but has often
been the cause of pestiferous disorders.  The putrid state of certain
diseases, and natural decay of bodies, contribute to an infection, by air
and humidity, that operates (though imperceptibly) on the lungs.  If
_burial grounds_ were appropriated on _Mousehold heath_, and properly
secured, the areas in which the churches now stand might be formed into
handsome grass-plats, both for use and ornament.

15.  The _Water-works_ at the _New-Mills_, if raised to a given height,
by such methods as are in used such cases, would convey a supply of water
to every part of the city, without the expence, trouble, and
inconvenience of reservoirs on _Tombland_, in _Chapel-field_, &c.  The
supply would be more certain, defeats easier discovered, and,
consequently, repairs sooner made.  Beside, _Tombland_, cleared of that
filthy building, would become a very elegant square.  And here, speaking
of this subject, we should also recommend the _Red Well_ to be taken
away, and the pump fixed elsewhere.

16.  An opening to the _Castle-ditches_, from the east end of the _Cockey
lane_, is much to be wished for: also one at the end of the
_White-lion-lane_.

17.  All the _Bridges_ in the city are very narrow and decayed, and the
avenues leading to them equally incommodious.  New bridges of one arch
each, and open streets, would be rendering the trade of this city, by
land and water carriage, an essential service.  At _Black-friars_, we are
told, a new bridge is now under consideration.  A bridge cross the water
at the _Duke’s Palace_, would open a communication from the market,
through _the Dove-lane_ and _St. John’s_, to _Colegate_.  But, at no
place is a bridge more wanted than at _King’s-street Gate_; by which the
time and trouble of going round by _Bishopsgate Bridge_ would be saved to
many.—N.B. The _Island_ formed by the river at _Coslany bridge_, has been
found to collect the filth of that neighbourhood, and, therefore, as a
nuisance, ought to be removed.

18.  Though Norwich has many excellent _Inns_, yet none of them are
handsome or spacious.  The _Coffee-houses_ are sufficiently good, and the
_Boarding-houses_ reasonable; but there is great want of a _Hotel and
Tavern_, to accommodate genteel families, parties, or persons of rank.

19.  In the MARKET-PLACE, the _Lower_, or _Gentleman’s Walk_ should be
flag’d and posted off from the carriage way, for a parade, exchange, or
place of business and pleasure.  This, tho’ it might cost something
considerable, would very much enhance the value of the shops and
dwellings on the walk, and afford gentlemen and merchants an opportunity
meeting to transact business, or to amuse themselves in walking and
conversation.  If a piazza or colonade was raised in front of the
Guildhall, it would greatly add to the beauty and convenience of the
market-place: as would also the taking away the houses on the east side
of _Weaver’s-lane_; and, if possible, opening _St. Peter’s Church_.

20.  The Saturday MARKET of Norwich has been long acknowledged the most
commodious and plentiful in England; but if the different articles of
provision on sale were classed and ranged methodically, into rows or
lanes, crossing each other at right angles, such regulation would be
attended with ease and satisfaction both to the buyer and seller.

Rome certainly was not built in a day, neither do we expect to see every
thing done in Norwich that might and ought to be; but, we hope, no local
or private consideration of emolument or prejudice, will be an impediment
in the way of PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT!  Though the elegant plan of Sir
Christopher Wren, for rebuilding the city of London, after the dreadful
fire in 1666, was, through prejudice and ignorance, rejected, the
citizens of London have seen, and regret, the evil consequences of narrow
minds, and narrow streets! and have done as much towards the
embellishment of that city, as time and opportunity would permit.  That
they are wealthy we allow, but then Norwich has its proportion of wealth,
as well as its men of taste and talents to execute.

this City, the dial-plates of which are said to front the Cardinal

Part of the Parishes of Hellesden, Catton, Sprowston, Thorpe, and Trowse,
belong to the county of the city of Norwich, viz. Trowse-Millgate,
Carrowe, Bracondale, &c.

Norwich, 43 miles north of Ipswich, 42 east of Lynn-Regis, and 108 miles
from London, near the conflux of the Yare, and another river called the
Wensom; 30 miles from the sea by water, and 18 by land; is a famous
ancient city, which had a castle so long ago as the 7th century.  It was
even in Cambden’s time reckoned among the most considerable cities in
Britain, for the industry of its citizens, their loyalty to their prince,
and civility to foreigners; as well as for its wealth, number of people,
and the neatness of their buildings.

It stands on the side of a hill, one mile and a half from north to south,
but little more than half as broad.  It was first destroyed, by Sweno the
Dane, but recovered so soon, that, in the reign of Edward the Confessor,
it had 1320 burghers; but in the reign of William the Conqueror, it being
the seat of a civil war raised against him by the earl of the
East-Angles, it was so impaired at to be reduced to 560 at most.

The Cathedral was founded here in 1096, by Herbert Lozinga, on the
translation of the bishop’s see hither from Thetford.

This place was built anew and first made a corporation by king Stephen,
who granted it to his son for an appendage; but Henry II. took it from
him, though Henry his son, then aspiring to the crown, had fully promised
it to Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, who miserably harrassed the city, and
is thought to have rebuilt the castle on the hill, which is encompassed
with a very deep trench, over which there is a strong bridge, of one very
large arch; but Lewis of France, under whom the barons confederated
against king John, besieged and took it.

This city having been all along governed by bailiffs, Henry IV. made it a
county of itself, and gave the inhabitants leave to chuse a mayor and two
sheriffs; and they built a beautiful town-house near the market-place.

In 1348, near 58,000 people died here of a pestilence; and in 1505, it
was almost entirely consumed by fire.  Though, as it has been said, it is
a populous city, yet there is void enough in it for another colony; and
from the intermixture of its houses with trees, it is called “a city in
an orchard.”

It adds much to the trade of Yarmouth by the vast cargoes of coal, wine,
fish, oil, and all other heavy goods, which come to it from thence by the
river Yare.  Its manufactures are generally sent to London, though
considerable quantities are exported from Yarmouth to Holland, Germany,
Sweden, Norway, Spain, &c.  It had a flint-stone wall, now much decayed,
three miles in compass, which was finished in 1309, and had 40 towers.
The city is now reckoned six miles in compass: it has twelve gates, and
six bridges over the Yare; above 7500 houses, and 45,000 inhabitants.  It
had 58 parochial churches and chapels formerly, besides monasteries, and
now has 34 churches, besides the cathedral, chapels, and four dissenting
meeting-houses.  The roof of the cathedral (whose steeple is 509 feet
high) is adorned with historical passages of the Bible, expressed in
little images.  St. Peter’s of Mancroft is esteemed one of the handsomest
parish churches in England.  There are two churches for the Dutch and
French-Flemings, who have singular privileges, which are strictly
preserved.  Most of the churches are crusted with flints curiously cut.
The castle is the common goal for the county.  Its Guildhall was formerly
a monastery, and afterwards the toll-booth.  In 1413, the present fabric
was finished, and the city records deposited therein.  It is an irregular
but commodious building, having many suitable apartments, and some good
pictures.

The Bridewell, which is a very large and curious building, is of square
flint and stone; and in 1736, the lofty market-cross, of free-stone, was
taken down.—Here is that called the King’s School, founded by Edward VI.
for teaching grammar learning to boys that are nominated by the mayor and
aldermen.

Here are four hospitals; one of them, St. Giles’s, founded originally for
the entertainment of strangers, was, by Henry VIII. appropriated to the
poor of the city; and here are maintained 80 poor men and women, who are
all cloathed in grey, and must be sixty years old.  There is another for
16 poor men and eight women, whose livery is purple.  The boys and girls
hospital contain 30 of each, and the boys are from hence put out
apprentices.  Here are besides 12 charity schools, where 300 boys and 150
girls are taught, cloathed and supplied with books.

It is governed by a mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs, 24 aldermen,
and 60 common council-men; with a town-clerk, sword-bearer, &c.  The
mayor, who is always chosen by the freemen on May-day, out of two
aldermen, whom they then return to the court, is sworn into his office
with great pomp, on the Tuesday before Midsummer eve.  He is, during his
year, a justice of the peace, and of the quorum, (as are also the
recorder and steward) within the city and its liberties; and after his
mayoralty, he is justice of the peace for life.  Two silver maces are
always borne before the mayor, gilt and finely chased.

The sheriffs are also annually elected, one by the aldermen, the other by
the freemen, on the last Tuesday in August, and sworn September 29.  The
common council are chosen in Mid-lent.  The sheriffs are obliged by their
charter to present the king with twelve herring pies yearly, on the 23d
of October, this city being possessed of the manor of Carlton, whose lord
holds it by that tenure.

The worsted manufacture, for which this city has long been famous, and in
which even children earn their bread, was first brought over by the
Flemings, in the reign of Edward III. and afterwards very much improved
by the Dutch, who fled from the duke of Alva’s persecution, and being
settled here by queen Elizabeth, taught the inhabitants to make says,
baize, serges, shalloons, &c. in which they carry on a vast trade, both
at home and abroad, and weave camblets, druggets, crapes, and other
stuffs, of which it is said this city vends to the value of 200,000l. a
year.

The weavers here employ spinners all the country round; and also use many
thousand packs of yarn spun in other counties.  By a late calculation,
from the number of looms at work in this city only, it appeared that
there were no less than one hundred thousand people employed in their
manufactures of wool, silk, &c. in and about the town, including those
employed in spinning the yarn used for such goods as are made in the
city.

The inhabitants are generally so employed in their manufactures within
doors, that this appears a melancholy place, except on Sundays and public
days, when the streets swarm with them.

By an act in 1726, certain duties are laid on goods brought into this
city, for the repair of its bridges, walls, gates, the staiths, wharfs
and roads.—Markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and a market for horses
and cattle every Saturday on the Castle Ditches; also the following
fairs, viz. Maundy Thursday, and Saturday before Whitsuntide, on
Tombland; Easter and Whitsun Monday and Tuesday, without Bishopsgate; St.
Faith’s, the Tuesday after St. Michael, and Maudlin, or St. Mary
Magdalen.

The Yare, which runs through the city, is navigable so far without the
help of locks.

The Shire house of the county, that stood on the hill near the castle,
having been burnt down by accident, an act of parliament passed in
1746/7, for holding the summer assizes and general quarter sessions in
the city, till a new Shire-house was rebuilt; and for raising money to
defray the charge of it.—On a hill on the other side of the river, are
the remains of the castle of Kett, the tanner, of Wymondham, by whose
rebellion, in the reign of Edward VI. this city was reduced to a ruinous
state.

In the suburbs were formerly three parochial churches, besides three
chapels, a nunnery with its church, a priory and church, an hospital and
chapel, and five leper houses at the gates, with their chapels; and the
Jews had once a synagogue here.

Besides the cathedral, castle, guild-hall, bridewell, churches, and other
public buildings already mentioned, the bishop hath a palace on the north
side of the cathedral, to which belong gardens elegantly laid out.  The
Free Grammar-school near this, is a neat spacious gothic building,
formerly used as the charnel-house.  The Deanry, and its offices, are
situated in the Close; but neither these, or the Prebendaries, have any
pretensions to uniformity.

The New Hall in St. Andrew’s, in which the Mayor’s guild-feasts are held,
is a very handsome building, fifty yards long and thirty wide.  It was
founded about the year 1428, and was the place where the company of St.
George used to hold their meetings of business and pleasure.  It is now
the common hall of the city, and is decorated with portraits of many
eminent persons.

The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital was built by voluntary subscription in
1772.  It is a very neat edifice, well supported, and properly
conducted.—Bethel is an hospital for lunatics, founded in 1713, under
good regulation.—What is called the Duke’s Palace, and now converted into
a workhouse for the poor, was formerly the residence of the dukes of
Norfolk.

Cooke’s Hospital, in the Rose-lane, maintains ten poor women; and
Doughty’s, which was founded in 1687, supports 24 poor men and eight
women.

The city prison is opposite the Guild-hall: It is a close building, where
debtors and the felons are kept.

The quarter-sessions of Norfolk is held at the Castle in January, April,
July, and October; and also for the city of Norwich.  The Lent assize of
the county is held at Thetford and the summer assize at Norwich; at
which, also, the city prisoners are tried.

The Theatre-Royal was erected upon patent in 1768, and is a handsome
house.  The Assembly-Rooms next it are spacious and brilliant; and the
Concert-Room, in Redwell-street, is well attended weekly:—supported by a
subscription of its members.

The public gardens are Bunn’s, or the Pantheon, formerly Spring Gardens;
and Quantrell’s, or the Rural Gardens.  These, particularly in the assize
week, are much frequented, and concerts of vocal and instrumental music
given.

Mr. Arthur Young, in his Tour through the East of England, (1771) says,
“The city of Norwich is one of the most considerable in England after
London; it stands on more ground than any other, but in number of
inhabitants, some others assert an equality.  By an accurate account
taken a few years ago, the number reckoned by the houses amounted to
forty thousand; but by the bills of mortality only to thirty-six
thousand; the average therefore of these (thirty-eight thousand) may be
taken as more probable than either.”

In July, 1752, a parochial list was taken of the number of houses and
inhabitants within the city of Norwich, precincts of the Close, and the
hamlets or suburbs belonging to the said city, as followeth: By comparing
of which with the account of the inhabitants taken in 1693, inserted in
the 3d column, we shall see how greatly the number of the people has been
increased in the course of sixty years, owing to the prodigious extension
of its trade during that period.

Seven or eight hundred souls are supported in the two work-houses at
about 10,000l. a year, in all expences; and near 3000l. yearly is paid in
weekly allowances to poor out of the houses.

By a late regulation, the children of St. John’s workhouse are employed
in rooms fitted up for them in Colegate-street; in street also, the
children of St. Andrew’s workhouse are employed in spinning yarn.  About
250 poor children are hereby enabled to contribute towards their own
maintenance,—their health and morals improved, and the public much
benefited!

In the present century the manufacture is increased as from four to
twelve.

During the last war, Norwich supplied the army and navy with four
thousand recruits; but her manufactures did not suffer in the least; for
they carried on more trade than ever.  The truly industrious do not
inlist; and as to the idle, the greatest favour to be done to any place
is to sweep them all away.

They are in this city curious in building with flint: they cut it in
regular squares, and form as neat joints as with the best bricks.  The
Bridewell is thus built, and so well executed, that it is worth a
traveller’s notice.

The husbandry near Norwich is generally good.  About Earlham farms rise
from 50l. to 200l. a year: the soil a loamy sand, with both marle and
chalk under it; lets from 14s. to 20s. an acre; average 16s.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
